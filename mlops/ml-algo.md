## 📌 Why Algorithms Matter (Simply)
An **ML algorithm** is just a **method** the model uses to learn patterns from data.

Think of algorithms like **different problem-solving styles**.

---

## 🧩 How to Choose an Algorithm (Golden Rule)

| Problem Type | Algorithm Type |
|------------|---------------|
| Predict a number | Regression |
| Predict a category | Classification |
| Group similar items | Clustering |
| Find unusual data | Anomaly Detection |

---

## 🔢 1️⃣ Regression Algorithms

### 👉 When to use
When output is a **number**.

### 📌 Examples
- House price prediction
- Salary prediction
- Sales forecasting

---

### 🟦 Linear Regression
**Idea:** Draw a best-fit line

- Simple
- Fast
- Easy to understand

**Used when:** Data has linear relationship

---

### 🟦 Decision Tree (Regression)
**Idea:** Ask questions like a flowchart

- Easy to explain
- Handles non-linear data

---

### 🟦 Random Forest (Regression)
**Idea:** Many decision trees vote together

- More accurate
- Less overfitting

---

## 🏷️ 2️⃣ Classification Algorithms

### 👉 When to use
When output is a **label/category**.

### 📌 Examples
- Spam vs Not Spam
- Fraud vs Normal
- Disease Yes/No

---

### 🟩 Logistic Regression
**Idea:** Probability-based classification

- Simple
- Widely used
- Very interview-friendly

---

### 🟩 Decision Tree (Classification)
**Idea:** Question-based decisions

- Explainable
- Used in regulated industries

---

### 🟩 Random Forest (Classification)
**Idea:** Ensemble of trees

- High accuracy
- Stable

---

### 🟩 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
**Idea:** Best boundary between classes

- Good for small datasets
- Complex boundaries

---

## 🧠 3️⃣ Clustering Algorithms (Unsupervised)

### 👉 When to use
When data has **no labels**.

### 📌 Examples
- Customer segmentation
- Grouping similar users

---

### 🟨 K-Means Clustering
**Idea:** Group by similarity

- Fast
- Popular
- Needs number of clusters

---

### 🟨 Hierarchical Clustering
**Idea:** Tree-like grouping

- Visual
- Slower

---

## 🚨 4️⃣ Anomaly Detection

### 👉 When to use
When finding **unusual patterns**.

### 📌 Examples
- Fraud detection
- Network intrusion
- System failures

---

### 🟥 Isolation Forest
**Idea:** Isolate anomalies faster

- Very effective
- Common in security

---

## 🧠 5️⃣ Neural Networks (Intro Only)

### 👉 When to use
For complex patterns (images, text)

- Forms base of Deep Learning
- Not required deeply for MLOps

---

## ⚠️ Overfitting Control Algorithms

| Technique | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| Regularization | Reduce complexity |
| Cross-validation | Test robustness |
| Ensemble methods | Reduce variance |

---

## 🎯 Algorithm Selection Cheat Sheet

| Problem | Best Starting Algorithm |
|-------|------------------------|
| Regression | Linear / Random Forest |
| Classification | Logistic / Random Forest |
| Clustering | K-Means |
| Anomaly Detection | Isolation Forest |

---

## 🎯 How Much Algorithm Knowledge for MLOps?

| Area | Depth |
|----|------|
| Algorithm concepts | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ |
| Hyperparameters | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ |
| Math | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ |
| Research | ⭐☆☆☆☆ |

👉 MLOps focuses on **deploying & managing models**, not inventing algorithms.

---

## ❌ What You Can Skip (For MLOps)

- Writing algorithms from scratch
- Complex proofs
- Advanced DL architectures
